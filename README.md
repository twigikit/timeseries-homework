# timeseries-homework

This exercise requires using Google Colab to produce a Jupyter notebook that contains data preparation, analysis (including predictive modelling) and visualisations for all the time series used.

Key objectives of the exercise are:
* Identify patterns in the time series data. We look at three set of time series data: <br>
1. Google hourly search trends on Mercado Libre from 2016-2020 <br>
2. Mercado Libre hourly stock prices from 2015-2020 <br>
3. Mercado Libre daily sales revenue from 2019-2020 <br>

* Mining for patterns in seasonality by using visualisations <br>
* building sales-forecast and user-interest predictive models by applying a Prophet forecasting model to the data.
